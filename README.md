# Greedy-Algorithm-knapsack-Algorithm
The knapsack problem is used to analyze both problem and solution. In this problem, we will be given n items along with the weights and values of it. The task is to choose the set of weights that fill the maximum capacity of the bag. The condition here is the set which we are choosing must contain the highest number of elements than the other sets and the total weight must be less than or equal to the given weight. That means weight must be lesser and at the same time value must be as large as possible
